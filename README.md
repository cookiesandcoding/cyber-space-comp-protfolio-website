# Basic Portfolio Website for Build and Deploy Competition held by Cyber Space 🚀

For the BUILD ND DEPLOY competition held by the Cyber Space Club, I developed a basic portfolio website with a focus on simplicity and functionality. 🌟 The design features a clean, minimalistic layout that effectively showcases the key elements of the portfolio. 🖥️ The homepage includes a brief introduction, a clear navigation menu, and sections dedicated to projects, skills, and contact information. 📑 The use of a straightforward color scheme and basic typography ensures that the content is easy to read and visually appealing. 🎨 This simple yet effective design allows visitors to quickly understand the portfolio's content and my competencies. 💼🛠️ With intuitive navigation and a focus on essential information, the website is perfectly suited for a competition centered on practical, deployable web solutions. 🚀✨🔗
